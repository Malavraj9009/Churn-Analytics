# Churn-Analytics
From the Churn dataset, containing 3333 tuples and 21 features. Our aim is to find out what is the probability of a customer to churn, where churn(Target Variable) =TRUE indicates that the customer will churn and churn=FALSE indicates the customer will stay with the current operator.

I have used some EDA and made the model using Logistic Regression wherein I have considered only 1 target and 1 feature variable.
You can work out with other feature variables and create other model also.
